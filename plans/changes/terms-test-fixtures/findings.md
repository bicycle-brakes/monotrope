# Findings — terms-test-fixtures

Stage-2 call, 2026-10-27: draft · attempt 1 · route codex · endpoint openai-codex · model gpt-6.1-sol · leak check clean over 705 files, 2383 commits, 12 rules.

## Draft validation — 2026-10-27

Baseline `e4f84f04`; spec and plan drafted, implementation not started.
No phase-2a rows were present to resolve. The bounded class requires neither
`design.md` nor an ADR draft. Repository gaps read during drafting are appended
to `research.md`; the maintainer's decisions and interview skip are unchanged.

- `python3 scripts/check_interview_minimums.py --change terms-test-fixtures`
  — exit 0; this change's reasoned skip satisfies the bounded minimum.
- `python3 scripts/check_criterion_ledger.py` — exit 0; existing test names
  resolve and the two new tests remain explicitly not yet written.
- `python3 scripts/check_research_handoff.py --change terms-test-fixtures`
  — exit 0; exempt because no research-swarm/v2 evidence exists.
- `git diff --check` — exit 0 on tracked edits at drafting.
- Draft structure check — exit 0; required headers, six refuting cases,
  bounded class, a single criterion ledger and empty time section checked.
- `scripts/validate_change_artefacts.py` is absent, so that check was not run.
  `templates/plan.md` is absent too; the plan follows `prompts/03-plan.md`.
- `make verify`, the contract-fault demonstration, and the three loaded runs
  are not run in this draft. The runner owns full verification, derived index
  refresh and the commit. No tracker writes, commits or mutating git commands
  were run.
- PR state is not read: `gh pr view` could not connect to GitHub.

Next: the orchestrator presents the plan card unchanged, then runs phase 4
within its two-hour appetite. Record measured implementation time in `plan.md`
and full-run evidence here; do not infer test success from this draft's checks.

Stage-2 call, 2026-10-27: draft · attempt 2 · route codex-repair · endpoint openai-codex · model gpt-6.1-sol · reason the first draft attempt failed · leak check clean over 708 files, 2384 commits, 12 rules.

## Draft attempt 2 validation — 2026-10-27

Baseline remains `e4f84f04`. Added the required document header to
`decisions.md`; its body, including the interview skip and agent decisions,
is byte-for-byte unchanged. The spec's class and six acceptance criteria are
unchanged. The plan now carries the first attempt's external verification
blockers forward. No phase-2a rows were found; no design or ADR is due for
this bounded change. Implementation has not started.

Measured after the repair:

- `python3 scripts/check_interview_minimums.py --change terms-test-fixtures`
  — exit 0; the reasoned skip still satisfies the bounded minimum.
- `python3 scripts/check_criterion_ledger.py` — exit 0; test references
  resolve and the two proposed helper tests remain not yet written.
- `python3 scripts/check_research_handoff.py --change terms-test-fixtures`
  — exit 0 with the explicit legacy exemption, not a swarm handoff review.
- `python3 scripts/check_frontmatter_current.py` — exit 0; the missing
  decisions header reported by attempt 1 is repaired.
- `git diff --check` — exit 0. A structure check also confirmed required
  headers, six refuting cases, the opening plan card, one ledger, the empty
  time section and unchanged decisions body.

`make verify` is not rerun in this draft; the runner owns that check and the
commit. The previous run's tracker/artifact drift remains outside this
change's scope and has not been repaired or remeasured here. The absent
`scripts/validate_change_artefacts.py` remains unavailable. Current GitHub
PR state and external session registries were not read under the worktree-only
read boundary. No tracker writes or mutating git commands were run.

Resume: the orchestrator reruns full verification and presents the unchanged
plan card before phase 4. A red run is not completion evidence; report external
blockers without changing other packages or weakening criteria.

Stage-2 call, 2026-10-27: draft · attempt 3 · route glm · endpoint glm-coding-plan · model glm-5.3 · reason two Codex draft attempts failed · leak check clean over 708 files, 2384 commits, 12 rules.

## Draft attempt 3 validation — 2026-10-27

Attempt 3 (GLM 5.3) took the draft over unchanged in substance: the class and
six criteria of the spec, the card, the steps and the criterion ledger stand
as attempt 1 wrote them. Before adopting them, their claims were re-read
against the tree at `e4f84f04`:

- All six ledger test names are defined:
  `test_terms_problem_requires_an_iso_reading_date` and
  `test_paid_terms_require_a_retention_reading` in `tests/test_stage2.py`,
  `test_paid_terms_require_a_usable_expiry` and
  `test_expiry_preserves_prior_admission_guards` in
  `tests/test_stage2_terms_expiry.py`,
  `test_a_model_without_admitted_terms_or_cost_is_never_used` in
  `tests/test_stage2_research_availability.py`, and
  `test_terminal_record_survives_sigkill_after_the_outcome` in
  `tests/test_stage2_research_store.py`.
- The kill test still waits for two pipe lines through `pipe_line`
  (120-second deadline); its second child loops on the release file, its
  `audit` writes the launch record, and the three assertions (first result
  readable, `s2` absent from results, `interrupted == ["s2"]`) are as the
  plan's step 9 describes.
- `a_record` in `tests/test_stage2_terms_expiry.py` (five fields, no cost
  key, far-future expiry) and the plain cross-suite imports
  (`from test_stage2 import …`) confirm the builder shape and the import
  idiom of steps 1–8.

Changed in this attempt: the `produced_by` provenance of `spec.md` and
`plan.md` (now the GLM session), and the plan's verification-blocker
paragraph — attempt 2's sentence that the decisions header "is repaired"
was false once the runner put `decisions.md` back.

No shell is available to this drafting session, so the draft-side checks were
not re-run here; attempts 1 and 2 measured them green
(`check_interview_minimums.py`, `check_criterion_ledger.py`,
`check_research_handoff.py`, and `check_frontmatter_current.py` after the
header edit), and this attempt's edits touch none of the forms those gates
parse — verified against the gate sources, not by execution. `make verify`
remains the runner's, and its two known external blockers stand: the
plans-registry staleness drift of other changes, and this change's
`decisions.md` without a document header, which a draft may not add (the
runner reverts the edit) and which therefore needs a hand edit outside the
draft phase. A red or stopped run is not completion evidence.

Resume: the orchestrator adds the decisions header by hand, reruns full
verification, and presents the plan card unchanged before phase 4.

Stage-2 call, 2026-10-27: draft · attempt 1 · route codex · endpoint openai-codex · model gpt-6.1-sol · leak check clean over 708 files, 2390 commits, 12 rules.

## Renewed draft validation — 2026-10-27

Re-read the research, decisions, templates, prior draft diagnostics and the
named production/test seams at `454790ae`. The existing bounded class,
six acceptance criteria, two-hour appetite and plan card are unchanged.
No phase-2a rows or open ambiguities were present. No design or ADR is due.

Implemented in this draft: corrected the plan's obsolete missing-header
blocker, named the current baseline and displayed the verification command
verbatim. The decisions header is now present; its body is unchanged.
Updated spec and plan provenance to this Codex drafting session. Earlier
attempt records above remain historical evidence, not current-state claims.

Measured in this draft:

- `python3 scripts/check_interview_minimums.py --change terms-test-fixtures`
  — exit 0; the bounded interview skip satisfies the minimum.
- `python3 scripts/check_criterion_ledger.py` — exit 0; the existing test
  references resolve, and both proposed helper tests remain not yet written.
- `python3 scripts/check_research_handoff.py --change terms-test-fixtures`
  — exit 0, explicitly exempt without research-swarm/v2 evidence.
- `python3 scripts/check_frontmatter_current.py` — exit 0; current headers
  include the decisions header repaired before this draft.
- `git diff --check` and a draft structure check — exit 0; criteria,
  decisions and card match `HEAD`, the time section is empty, and changed
  paths stay inside this change folder.

The requested `scripts/validate_change_artefacts.py` and `templates/plan.md`
are absent from this tree. The plan follows `prompts/03-plan.md`; no passing
result is claimed for the absent validator. Full `make verify`, helper
contract-fault evidence and three loaded runs remain unperformed by this
draft; the runner owns full verification and the commit. Earlier tracker
drift was not remeasured. Current PR state, the shared tracker and external
session registries were not read under the worktree-only read boundary.
No tracker writes, implementation edits, commits or mutating git commands
were made. The phase-4 time section remains empty.

Resume: the orchestrator runs full verification and presents the unchanged
plan card before phase 4; report any external blocker without weakening the
criteria or repairing another change.

## Contract-fault demonstration — 2026-10-28

Measured by the orchestrator (Claude Code, Opus 5.5) for loop row L1-2 (plan
step 2), because `findings.md` is runner-owned and a repair attempt may not
write it.

- At `0b77e00e`, the `valid_until` default was removed from
  `admissible_terms` in `tests/terms_fixtures.py` (working tree only), then
  `python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider
  tests/test_terms_fixtures.py::test_default_terms_pass_production_admission`
  ran: **1 failed**, `AssertionError` with the production refusal "the model m
  has no usable terms expiry (valid_until is missing); the reading grants no
  admission".
- The default was restored (`git diff tests/terms_fixtures.py` empty), and
  `tests/test_terms_fixtures.py` ran again: **2 passed**.

## Three consecutive full verification runs — 2026-10-28

Measured by the orchestrator (Claude Code, Opus 5.5) for loop row L1-10 (spec
Definition of Done, plan step 10), one lane at a time on the machine, command
`make verify`, head `98682973`:

| Run | Start–end (UTC) | Duration | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 00:56:22–01:07:42 | 680 s | VERIFY GREEN |
| 2 | 01:07:42–01:19:20 | 698 s | VERIFY GREEN |
| 3 | 01:19:20–01:31:03 | 703 s | VERIFY GREEN |

`test_terminal_record_survives_sigkill_after_the_outcome` failed in none of
them (no mention of it in any run's output).

## Phase 6 — Codex, 2026-10-28

| ID | Severity | Dimension | Origin | Where | Finding | Reviewer | Status | Broke a test |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F6-1 | MAJOR | SPEC | Phase 6 | tests/test_stage2_research_store.py:209–220 | The kill regression passes if the driver exits with an error after persisting the first result and second launch audit: readiness breaks before the early-exit check, and the conditional skips SIGKILL. An in-memory reproduction with driver exit 1 passed all assertions and sent no signal. Reject an already-exited driver and verify termination by SIGKILL so this test actually exercises persistence across the required kill. [Acceptance criterion 5; plan step 9] | Codex | fixed — not a test — the change is in the test itself (green on the baseline by construction); tests/test_stage2_research_store.py::test_kill_regression_refuses_a_driver_not_terminated_by_sigkill fails in both cases against the old main test and passes now; full make verify green at 550f3caf (orchestrator acceptance) | no — full make verify green at 550f3caf |

Phase 6 verdict: codex 01a18120-544b-7a63-ac08-83250bf8c86a, 2026-10-28
Reviewer session: codex 01a18120-544b-7a63-ac08-83250bf8c86a — a fresh session reviewed: no phase-2a session was recorded

## Phase 4b — loop rows, released 2026-10-28

| ID | Severity | Dimension | Origin | Where | Finding | Reviewer | Status | Broke a test | Phase 6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| L1-1 | MAJOR | SPEC | deepseek-v4.1-flash | plans/changes/terms-test-fixtures/findings.md (end of file); spec.md, "Definition of Done" and acceptance criterion 6 | The spec's Definition of Done and its criterion 6 rest on consecutive complete verification runs being recorded with command, commit, date, outcome and duration in `findings.md`; that file holds no such record — its last entries are stage-2 call logs, and every full run it quotes ended red or was stopped by the runner's step limit. Nothing in the change shows the load-sensitive test passing under normal parallel verification, so the acceptance criterion that names this evidence is unsupported at review time. | deepseek-v4.1-flash | rejected — duplicate of L1-10 |  | disagree — findings.md records three consecutive green `make verify` runs with command, commit, date and durations. |
| L1-2 | MINOR | SPEC | deepseek-v4.1-flash | plan.md, step 2 and step 10; findings.md | Step 2 requires proving the new contract test goes red when a required builder default is removed temporarily, and step 10 promises `findings.md` carries that contract-fault evidence; `findings.md` contains none. A reader therefore cannot tell whether the contract test was ever observed failing, which is the only guard that the shared builder cannot silently fall behind the admission rule. | deepseek-v4.1-flash | fixed — not a test — demonstrated and recorded by the orchestrator in findings.md (contract test red without the valid_until default, green restored, at 0b77e00e) | no — evidence only; no code or test changed | disagree — findings.md records removal of `valid_until`, the resulting contract-test failure, restoration and two passing tests. |
| L1-3 | MINOR | MAINT | deepseek-v4.1-flash | plans/changes/terms-test-fixtures/research.md, opening paragraph and "Runner exploration" block | The research file still opens with its unfilled skeleton ("this file is empty until it has run") and a note asserting the frontmatter says `provenance: human-written`, although the frontmatter says `ai-drafted-reviewed`; the suggested-header block also states that the living implementation-verification spec "has not been read", while the later gap-check section says it was read. A maintainer cannot tell which statements describe the current tree. | deepseek-v4.1-flash | fixed — not a test — skeleton line and banner removed, misspelled path fixed, the read/not-read statements reconciled (orchestrator acceptance, checked against the diff) | no — three full make verify runs green at 98682973 | disagree — the skeleton statements are removed; the research explicitly distinguishes the initial unread spec from its later reading. |
| L1-4 | MINOR | MAINT | deepseek-v4.1-flash | tests/test_stage2_research_store.py, `test_terminal_record_survives_sigkill_after_the_outcome` | The test gives the driver both a stdout and a stderr pipe but drains neither while it waits, and the driver's own progress markers on stdout are now never read; should the driver's output ever exceed the pipe buffer the driver blocks, and the wait degrades into its timeout report with an empty stderr instead of the records it is waiting for — the load-sensitive failure the change removes returns as a deadlock. Drain the pipes in the wait loop or send them to a sink. | deepseek-v4.1-flash | fixed — not a test — the driver's stdout and stderr go to DEVNULL, so no pipe can fill or be held open | no — three full make verify runs green at 98682973 | disagree — driver stdout and stderr both use DEVNULL, so undrained pipes cannot block it. |
| L1-5 | MAJOR | SPEC | promise-not-done | plans/changes/terms-test-fixtures/findings.md (with spec.md Definition of Done and plan.md step 10) | The change promises three consecutive green `make verify` runs plus the contract-fault measurement recorded in findings.md with command, baseline, date, outcome and duration; findings.md contains only stage-2 call logs and failed-attempt diagnostics, its own newest sections say full verification is still the orchestrator's next check, and neither the fault evidence nor any run result or duration appears anywhere in the file. | mimo-v2.5 | rejected — duplicate of L1-10 |  | disagree — findings.md contains both the contract-fault measurement and three consecutive green verification runs. |
| L1-6 | MAJOR | SPEC | promise-not-done | plans/changes/terms-test-fixtures/plan.md — plan card and Time used section | The plan promises the three full verification runs inside a two-hour phase-4 appetite it declares a stop, but its own ledger records 5881 s of the 7200 s already spent on three implement attempts, while the full runs measured in this change's own diagnostics took 815 s, 1061 s and 1445 s each; the promised evidence cannot fit the remaining 1319 s, so the Definition of Done is unreachable without breaking the stated stop rule. | mimo-v2.5 | fixed — not a test — plan.md records the appetite stop and the maintainer's answer: continue, 4 hours in total | no — three full make verify runs green at 98682973 | disagree — the plan records the maintainer extending the total appetite to four hours. |
| L1-7 | MAJOR | MAINT | maintainer-trip | tests/test_stage2_research_store.py, test_terminal_record_survives_sigkill_after_the_outcome | Both failure branches of the new durable-record wait loop build their `pytest.fail` message with `proc.stderr.read()`, which reads to end-of-file; the second child that this test deliberately orphans is released only in the `finally` block, and under default subprocess inheritance it holds the driver's stderr pipe open, so once that child is running the read blocks and the `finally` that would release it never executes — the bounded 120 s failure becomes an unbounded hang of the whole verification run instead of the promised diagnostic. | mimo-v2.5 | fixed — not a test — the failure messages no longer read stderr to end of file | no — three full make verify runs green at 98682973 | disagree — neither failure branch reads stderr; both output streams use DEVNULL. |
| L1-8 | MINOR | MAINT | maintainer-trip | plans/changes/terms-test-fixtures/research.md | The research file still carries its untouched drafting skeleton: it announces "this file is empty until it has run" above a full document, instructs the writer to correct a `provenance: human-written` frontmatter that actually reads `ai-drafted-reviewed`, and keeps a typo with its correction inline ("plans/changes/terms-expxiry/findings.md — correction: ..."), so a maintainer cannot tell which of its instructions are still live. | mimo-v2.5 | rejected — duplicate of L1-3 |  | disagree — the cited skeleton text and inline path correction are absent. |
| L1-9 | MINOR | MAINT | maintainer-trip | plans/INDEX.md and the frontmatter of all five terms-test-fixtures artefacts | Every artefact and the index rows this change adds report `implementation_status: none`, yet plan.md's Time used section records three implementation attempts with the last one accepted and the diff adds the implementation itself (`tests/terms_fixtures.py` and the migrated suites); the same index shows `partial` for test-key-runtime, so a maintainer reads "no implementation" beside code that has landed. | mimo-v2.5 | fixed — not a test — implementation_status partial on every artefact of the change | no — three full make verify runs green at 98682973 | disagree — all five artefacts and their index entries report implementation_status: partial. |
| L1-10 | BLOCKER | SPEC | promised-not-done | plans/changes/terms-test-fixtures/findings.md (whole file), plans/changes/terms-test-fixtures/plan.md (card, step 10, Verification) | The spec's Definition of Done, the plan card's "Done when" and plan step 10 promise three consecutive green `make verify` runs plus the contract-fault demonstration, each recorded in findings.md with command, commit, date, outcome and duration. findings.md records no green run anywhere: its only full-run records are red `make verify` diagnostics (pytest, plans-registry and frontmatter-current gates failing, ruff SIM105), the rest are single-script draft checks, and the plan's Time used shows one accepted implement attempt (1464 s, about one run) rather than three. As the change stands it carries no completion evidence for its own stated Done condition. | mimo-v2.6-flash | fixed — not a test — three consecutive full make verify runs green at 98682973, recorded in findings.md | no — evidence only; no code or test changed | disagree — findings.md records the contract-fault demonstration and three consecutive green full runs at commit 98682973. |
| L1-11 | MINOR | MAINT | maintainer-trip | plans/changes/terms-test-fixtures/research.md (opening sections, "Where it lives") | The file still carries its untouched skeleton text above the finished research: "this file is empty until it has run" sits over a filled document, the note "The frontmatter says `provenance: human-written` — that holds for this skeleton" contradicts the file's own frontmatter (`provenance: ai-drafted-reviewed` with `produced_by`), and the "Where it lives" line opens with a misspelled path corrected mid-sentence ("`plans/changes/terms-expxiry/findings.md` — correction: `plans/changes/terms-expiry/findings.md`"). A maintainer who was not there cannot tell which of these statements still holds. | mimo-v2.6-flash | rejected — duplicate of L1-3 |  | disagree — the cited skeleton statements and misspelled path are absent. |
| L1-12 | MINOR | MAINT | maintainer-trip | tests/test_stage2_research_store.py, `test_terminal_record_survives_sigkill_after_the_outcome` | The rework replaced the exhaustive `(run,) = store.runs()` unpack with a wait loop that only inspects `run_ids[0]` and a closing `store.slot_records(run_id)` on that same first run. Any unexpected extra run in the store is no longer detected as such: the loop ignores every run but the first, so a leftover run either starves the condition until the 120 s deadline and fails with the misleading message "first result and second launch record not durable" (killing a healthy driver), or is the run the final assertions are made against instead of the driver's run. | mimo-v2.6-flash | fixed — not a test — the wait asserts at most one run and unpacks exactly one | no — three full make verify runs green at 98682973 | disagree — the loop rejects multiple runs explicitly and unpacks the sole candidate. |
| L2-1 | BLOCKER | SPEC | tests/test_stage2.py::test_terms_problem_requires_an_iso_reading_date | The parametrized case `{"gelesen": "", "uebersprungen": None}` routes to `del record["uebersprungen"]`, but `admissible_terms` plants no skip marker — `uebersprungen` is absent from the default record, so the deletion raises `KeyError` instead of exercising the admission refusal the case promises. The crash is recorded in `findings.md` (attempt-1 diagnostics, `FAILED … [changes6-False-no dated reading of its data terms]`). `record.pop(field, None)` would match the docstring's claim that a removal only guarantees absence. | 2 \| MAJOR \| MAINT \| tests/test_stage2_research_store.py::test_terminal_record_survives_sigkill_after_the_outcome \| `run_id` is initialized to `None` before the try block and assigned only inside the polling loop. When the driver exits early or the deadline is missed, `pytest.fail` raises inside try, `run_id` stays `None`, and the finally block calls `store.slot_records(None)` — a secondary error that masks the original failure and leaves a maintainer debugging the wrong cause. | longcat-2.0 | rejected — already fixed: the test removes with record.pop(field, None); its 8 cases pass at b721c968 and in three full runs; the cited failure is the rejected implement attempt 1. The second finding the member wrote into its Reviewer cell (run_id None in finally) is also rejected: store.slot_records(run_id) runs after the finally block, so a pytest.fail inside try never reaches it |  | disagree — removal uses record.pop(field, None), and the parametrized cases passed; slot_records(run_id) is outside finally and is not reached when pytest.fail raises. |
